## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about how to use CSS Grid from this project. I mostly have used Flexbox in the past, but for this project, a combination seemed to work well. I went with a mobile-first approach, which was easy enough using Flexbox. Moving to the desktop design, however, was a hurdle for me. Without messing too much with the mobile layout, I figured it would be most effective to just change the display in my `main` to `grid` in a media query. This way my mobile layout can be left untouched while I can modify the desktop layout using grid properties.

It was consfusing at first, since I am still new to grid, but after doing a bunch of research and watching videos online, I figured out a layout that seems to work pretty well. I still have a lot to learn, though, it feels like.

### Continued development

CSS Grid feels like a very powerful tool, and is one of the things I want to focus on learning and understanding more with these projects.
